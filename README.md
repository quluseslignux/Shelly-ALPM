### About

Shelly is a modern reimagination of the Arch Linux package manager, designed to be a more intuitive and user-friendly
alternative to `pacman` and `octopi`. Unlike other Arch package managers, Shelly offers a modern, visual interface with
a focus on
user experience and ease of use; It **IS NOT** built as a `pacman` wrapper or front-end. It is a complete reimagination
of how a user
interacts with their Arch Linux system, providing a more streamlined and intuitive experience.

## Quick Install

The recommended installation method for Shelly is for CachyOS or using CachyOS packages

```bash
sudo pacman -S shelly
```

This will download and install the latest release, including the UI and CLI tools.

To install with an AUR helper like yay or paru.

```bash
yay -S shelly
```

or

```bash
paru -S shelly
```

## Uninstall

#### For standard package removal

```bash
sudo pacman -Rns shelly
```

#### If installed from AUR

```bash
yay -Rns shelly
```

or

```bash
paru -Rns shelly
```

## Features

- **Modern-CLI**: Provides a command-line interface for advanced users and automation, with a focus on ease of use.
- **Native Arch Integration**: Directly interacts with `libalpm` for accurate and fast package management.
- **Native Wayland Support**: Front end built using GTK4.
- **Package Management**: Supports searching and filtering for, installing, updating, and removing packages.
- **Repository Management**: Synchronizes with official repositories to keep package lists up to date.
- **AUR Support**: Integration with the Arch User Repository for a wider range of software.
- **Flatpak Support**: Manage Flatpak applications alongside native packages.

## Roadmap

Upcoming features and development targets:

- **Trigger updates from Notifications**: Allow users to trigger package updates from the notification system.
- **Repository Modification**: Allow modification of supported repositories (In progress).
- **App Image Support**: Further app image support similar to [AppLever](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever). (In
  progress)
- **Flatpak Overhaul**: Improve Flatpak integration and management. Allow for management of flatpak app stream
  locations. (In progress)
- **Package Import**: Allow for import of a previously existing package list to bring the system back to a saved package
  state. (Not yet started)
- **Icons for Standard Packages**: Allow icons for standard package applications to be viewed while searching for 
  packages. (Architecting)

## Prerequisites

- **Arch Linux** (or an Arch-based distribution)
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** (for building)
- **libalpm** (provided by `pacman`)

#### Optional Prerequisites

- **Flatpak**: Can be installed via shelly inside settings by turning flatpak on.

## Installation

### Using PKGBUILD

Since Shelly is designed for Arch Linux, you can build and install it using the provided `PKGBUILD`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZoeyErinBauer/Shelly-ALPM.git
cd Shelly-ALPM
makepkg -si
```

### Manual Build

You can also build the project manually using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet publish Shelly-UI/Shelly-UI.csproj -c Release -o publish/shelly-ui
dotnet publish Shelly-CLI/Shelly-CLI.csproj -C Release -o publish/shelly-cli
dotnet publish Shelly-CLI/Shelly-CLI.csproj -C Release -o publish/shelly-notifications
```

alternatively, you can run

```bash
sudo ./local-install.sh
```

This will build and perform the functions of install.sh

The binary will be located in the `/opt/shelly` directory.

## Usage

Run the application from your terminal:

For ui:

```bash
shelly-ui
```

For cli:

```bash
shelly
```

Notifications will be started with the ui, or it can be configured to launch at startup using your systems startup
configuration to run:

```bash
shelly-notifications
```

## Shelly-CLI

Shelly also includes a command-line interface (`shelly-cli`) for users who prefer terminal-based package management. The
CLI provides the same core functionality as the UI but in a scriptable, terminal-friendly format.
